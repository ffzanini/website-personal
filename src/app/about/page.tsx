              Hello! My name is Felipe Frantz Zanini, a Frontend Developer &
              Tech Lead, passionate about technology, music, art, jiu jitsu and
              reading. Im 30 years old, based in Balneário Camboriú, Santa
              Catarina. I started in the development world in 2008 in technical
              education. I fell in love with this life after my first algorithm
              class. I started effectively as a programmer in 2010, when I got
              my first job out of high school. Since then, 12 years have been
              dedicated to creating solutions and serving as a bridge between
              people and technology. I currently work as a frontend developer at
              Nave.rs creating digital products, custom web solutions for the
              best customer experience, helping companies organize and scale
              their products. See my resume here. Since I started working, I
              have participated in the development of several applications for
              the most diverse sectors and in reference companies such as: Banco
              ABC, UFC, SBT, Grupo SEB, Rede AZ, research groups, among others.
